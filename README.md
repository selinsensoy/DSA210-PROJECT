# Impacts of Wind Direction and Speed on Fuel Consumption in Commercial Flights

 This project aims to  understand the effects of wind direction and wind speed on fuel consumption in commercial flights. This will be beneficial in terms of sustainability since fuel usage impacts both costs and the environment.
During this project, how fuel consumption in commercial flights is affected by wind direction and wind speed between United States and Europe will be analyzed.  

## Data That Will Be Used
**Flight Data:** Data of commercial flights between United States and Europe.  
  
-Distance flown (km).  
-Flight duration(h).  
-Speed (km/h).  
-Altitude (ft).  
-Route.  
-Aircraft model.  
  
**Wind Data:** Wind path and wind speed along the flight path.  
  
-Wind speed (km/h) in different altitudes.  
-Wind direction in different altitudes.  
-Jet streams(Head wind or Tail wind) and turbulence regions.  
  
**Fuel Consumption Data:** Fuel usage statistics for flights.  
  
-Fuel burned (kg). 
  
## Data Source
**Wind data:** ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts).  
Offers wind data which includes wind speed, direction, and patterns over the Atlantic Ocean (between United States and Europe).  
  
**Flight Data:** Eurocontrol.  
Offers real-time and historical flight data to airlines, airports, and aviation authorities.  
  
**Fuel consumption Data:** Eurocontrol.  
Also provides data on fuel consumption and route efficiency.  
  
## Hypotheses
**Null Hypothesis:** Wind speed and direction have no impact on fuel consumption in commercial flights.  
**Alternative Hypothesis:** Wind speed and direction have a significant impact on fuel consumption in commercial flights since.
